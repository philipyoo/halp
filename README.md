# Informational Command

My personal information command

## Setup

Place the script where most convenient. But the folder path must be added to your $PATH environment variable. It may also be best to place in your personal root directory so you can edit it easily.

$ cd
$ git clone <repo>
$ PATH=$PATH:~/.halp

Now you're ready to edit and/or use

## Usage

```
$ halp
> test, git, docker, redis, ssh

$ halp git
> # helpful tip 1
> git status
> # helpful tip 2
> git fetch
```
